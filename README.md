# Dynamic-Traffic-System-DSA-project-
This project implements a Dynamic Traffic Management System using graph algorithms in C++. The system will simulate real-world traffic conditions and optimize traffic flow using Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm, A Search, Floyd-Warshall Algorithm, Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), and Max-Flow Algorithm
